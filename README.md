## Basic Details

### Team Name: [Wildx]

### Team Members

### Hosted Project Link
[https://github.com/annrose2277-glitch/AI_Assistance_for_blinds.git]

### Project Description
[This project modernizes traditional navigational aids by integrating computer vision and sensor fusion into an intelligent assistive device. By detecting objects in real-time and converting visual data into auditory feedback via text-to-speech, we provide visually impaired users to enable greater independence and confidence in navigation.]

### The Problem statement
[Visually impaired individuals face significant barriers to independent mobility and experience social anxiety due to a reliance on sighted assistance. This dependency is primarily caused by the limitations of traditional white canes, which provide only tactile, ground-level feedback and lack the capability to detect mid-air obstacles, identify specific objects, or provide the environmental context necessary for safe, confident navigation.]

### The Solution
[Our prototype transforms the standard white cane into an intelligent navigation assistant. By mounting a lightweight webcam and an AI-processing unit onto the cane

Computer Vision (The Eyes): We utilize the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. Unlike traditional models, YOLO scans the entire camera frame in one pass, making it incredibly fast for real-time detection.

The "40% Rule" (Smart Filtering): To prevent the user from being overwhelmed by too much information, the system only triggers a high-priority alert when an object’s bounding box covers 40% of the camera's view. This ensures we are reporting the most relevant, immediate obstacles.

Voice Interface (The Guide): Using the Pyttsx3 library, the system converts the AI's visual data into clear speech. Instead of a beep, the user hears: "An object is in front of you: [Object Name]."]
